    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>

            <li><p>Heat 5 inches of oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C).</p>
                <p>While oil is heating, make the batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg and water.</p>
                <p>Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and pepper; whisk into the egg mixture until smooth.</p>
                <p>Set aside in the refrigerator.</p></li>

            <li><p>Assemble sandwiches by placing one slice of turkey on one slice of bread, a slice of ham on another, then sandwich them with the Swiss cheese in the middle.</p>
                <p>Cut sandwiches into quarters, and secure with toothpicks.</p></li>

            <li><p>Dip each sandwich quarter in the batter so that all sides are coated.</p>
                <p>Deep fry in the hot oil until golden brown on all sides.</p>
                <p>Remove toothpicks and arrange on a serving tray.</p>
                <p>Dust with confectioners' sugar just before serving.</p></li>
