    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.</p>
        <p>A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</p>
        <p>I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

        <p><li><strong>Meat:</strong><i> This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Onion:</strong><i> A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Canned Tomatoes:</strong><i> You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Fresh Herbs:</strong><i> For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Sugar:</strong><i> A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong><i> This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Noodles:</strong> <i>Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</i></li></p>

        <p><li><strong>Cheese:</strong><i> The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</i></li></p>
        

        <p><li><strong>Eggs:</strong><i> Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</i></li></p>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>

        <p><li><strong>Cook the meat:</strong></p>

                <p><i>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent.</i></p>
            
                <p><i>Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</i></p>

        <p><li><strong>Cook the noodles:</strong></li></p>
            <p><i>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</i></p>

        <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna:</strong></li>
            <p><i>Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</i></p>

        <li><strong>Bake the lasagna:</strong></li>
            <p><i>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</p></i>
